		epigenetic mechanism that is involved in transcriptional silencing \
		of developmental genes. Several molecular pathways have been described \
		that interfere with Pol II initiation, but at individual genes the molecular \
		mechanism of repression remains uncertain. Here, we study the molecular mechanism \
		of transcriptional regulation at Hox genes in dependence of the epigenetic \
		regulator Lsh that controls CpG methylation at selected Hox genes. \
		Wild type cells show a nucleosomal deprived region around the transcriptional \
		start site at methylated Hox genes and mediate gene silencing via Pol II stalling. \
		Hypomethylation in Lsh-/- cells is associated with efficient transcriptional elongation \
		and splicing, in part mediated by the chromodomain protein Chd1. Dynamic modulation of DNA \
		methylation in Lsh-/- and wild type cells demonstrates that catalytically active DNA \
		methyltransferase activity is required for Pol II stalling. Taken together, the data suggests \
		that DNA methylation can be compatible with Pol II binding at selected genes and Pol II stalling \
		can act as alternate mechanism to explain transcriptional silencing associated with DNA methylation.'
